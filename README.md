Java Code Examples

This code are just an example on how to solve simple problems or exercises that you come up with at work or during your studies.
Note: if you happen to read this examples and you have a better implementations to suggest, feel free, we can have a chat about it and update the code! ;)

I try to keep this GitHub as much as possible updated, down here a list of branches available (each one as a bunch of exercices).

```
 -LamdaStreams;
 -Pattern;
 -Recursion;
```
